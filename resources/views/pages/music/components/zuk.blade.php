                Zuk is a multi-talented musician and DJ. His DJ work centers mainly around deep house, but also includes elements of
                trip-hop, jazz and world music. Zuk has worked with such greats as Juini Booth and Gregory Davis and was an integral
                part of Jazzopetry from the very beginning.
