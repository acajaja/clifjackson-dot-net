            <h3>April, 2013</h3>
            <p>
                "A moody, introspective disc full of contrasting guitar styles, breathtaking vocals and tightly written
                tunes from one of New York's most compelling indie folk/rock acts."

                The Whispering Tree is a duo of Eleanor Kleiner & Elie Brangbour. Writing great original music with a
                multitude of influences seamlessly blended into their own style. They sometimes bring me in to be part of the
                full band for live shows & doing the studio recording for their latest EP.
